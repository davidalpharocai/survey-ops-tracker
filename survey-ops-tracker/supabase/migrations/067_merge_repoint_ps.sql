-- 067: merge_projects now re-points PS suppliers + launches (previously orphaned).
--
-- merge_projects re-points every child table onto the survivor, but 061's
-- project_launches and its project_suppliers were never added — so merging two
-- PS projects left the retired copy's launches/suppliers stranded on the
-- soft-deleted loser (lost from the survivor, and their cost dropped out of the
-- survivor's actual_spend). Add both re-points, then recompute the survivor's
-- spend so Σ(CPI × N collected) from the merged-in suppliers is reflected.
--
-- Safety: project_launches has no project-scoped unique constraint (re-point is
-- free); project_suppliers is unique on (launch_id, supplier_id) and we only
-- change project_id (launch_id is untouched, and the loser's launch_ids are
-- distinct from the survivor's), so no collision is possible. Rebuilt from 066;
-- only the two new UPDATEs + the recompute are added.
