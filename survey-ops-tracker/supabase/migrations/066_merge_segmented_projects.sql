-- 066: allow merging projects that have N segments.
--
-- 044's merge_projects hard-blocked when EITHER side had project_segments
-- ("Un-split segmented N before merging") — which makes deduping two segmented
-- surveys (e.g. the two "Mattress Firm Employees & Non-Employees" copies)
-- impossible without manually un-splitting both first.
--
-- For a dedup the survivor's N is authoritative, so instead of blocking we
-- DISCARD the retired duplicate's segments (they go away with the retired copy)
-- and leave the survivor's untouched. Pick the segmented survey as the survivor
-- to keep its breakdown. Only that guard changes; everything else is identical
-- to 044.
